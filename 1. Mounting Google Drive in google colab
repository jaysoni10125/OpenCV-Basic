First we need to mount the google drive into the google colab, then only we will be able to open the images and test on them with our code.
Write(Copy nd Paste) the below code in google colab and hit "ctrl + enter".

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/gdrive')
%cd /gdrive

Then a link will be provided after the code runs, visit that link to attach your Gdrive account and copy the Autentication code provided in the website.
You will be asked about that authentication code below the website link so as to link your account.

After completing the process you will be able to see that your Gdrive has been mounted in Google Colab.

OR

You can directly open the google colab from the Google Drive by right clicking and then selecting more and in that selecting the Google Colab.
This way your google drive will be mounted automatically to the Google colab
